#### First and foremost:
###### Understanding context
The context of the question is of a problem faced by an organization.  
Such problems and organizations are easy to find, e.g. googling the top 10 industries and its companines in the world.  
Look at such organizations and think from a Administrative/Paper/HR/Logistics perspective -- What are some of the problems they can face?

In my contexts, I will make use of 3 companies from 3 different industries:

1. Singapore Airlines -- stocktaking of aircraft, airline ticket booking system, airline check-in system
2. DBS -- top investments, top people who owe bank money, accounting books, payroll system, interest payout system, atm system
3. Marche -- staff scheduling systems, peformance ranking systems, food stock-taking system, cashier system, food ordering system
