### 2) Development  

1. Documentation  
2. Programming  
3. Testing  

**Q1)**  
What are the components of a Documentation?  

Documentations can be split into two main groups:  

1. Technical/Maintenance documentation 
2. User documentation  

Its purpose is to provide client with materials to teach how to use software/system as intended  
For user documentation, think of those user manuals that come in the boxes of electrical appliances:  

1. Purpose of system  
2. Minimum hardware and software requirements  
3. Installation procedure  
4. Detailed "How-To"s (e.g. tutorials that show example input and its expected output)  

**Q2)**  
What are the types of programming paradigms?  
Top down vs Bottom up  

Top down includes defining a problem, then subsequently breaking it down further into smaller sub-problems, until the problems are sufficiently small enough to be tackled on their own. They are later combined together to form the final program  

Bottom up includes solving fundamental problems and integrating them into a larger one.

**Q3)**  
What are the types of testing and its pros and cons?   

| Testing Type | Black Box                                                    | White Box                                                    | Alpha                                                        | Beta                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Description  | Comparing results with actual results, without full knowledge of the working code | Using suitable test cases and full knowledge of the code being tested, check that every path in the code produces the right result | Testing of software by in-house software testers             | Testing of software by a limited number of chosen users before general release |
| Purpose      | Evaluate if the model does what it is meant to do            | Comprehensively evaluate that the code is correct            | To evaluate the functionality and usability of the product   | In addition to evaluating whether product works as intended, evaluate if program is secure, reliable and collect feedback on how  it can be improved. |
| Pros         | 1. Relatively faster<br />2. Need not have any knowledge of code/language used | Assuming that test cases are well designed, this testing methodology will be able to find many available bugs | Able to uncover critical bugs that were not caught in previous types of testing before product is released to public | Cost effective method of improving product quality via consumer feedback |
| Cons         | Require clear and concise specifications to design test cases | Tedious to devise test case to run through every path        | 1. Unable to test for other  things (e.g. Reliability and Security of program)<br />2. Not as in depth as testing is conducted under lab conditions | Challenging to find sufficient and right beta users, as well as sustaining their participation |
