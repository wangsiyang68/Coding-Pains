Q1)  
  a) What are 3 methods that a system analyst can use to find out more about information?  
  b) Who to interview?  
  
3 main ways to find out more info - 1) Interview, 2) Survey, 3) Observation  
Explain characteristics of the three fact-finding types:  
(expln)

Therefore,  
  1. Interview CEO/Head of Admin/Head of HR  
  2. Give survey for many mid-level workers  
  3. Observe how work is done from the start point to the end point  

Q2) What are some of the common problems?  
Paper systems:  
    lack data integrity as same information can be stored in multiple paper systems, resulting in data redundancy which promotes data disintegrity?  
    lack data validation systems to prevent wrong data types from being entered  
    lack data verification systems (i.e. accidentally typing in wrong password, typing in amount of money owed,  
Other problems faced:  
    Company has scaled up, cannot deal with so much data  
    Improve quality/save costs by automating repetitive tasks  
    Tech has become old/backward/prone to failure over a long period of time  

Q3) What are the components in the Report?  
1st half - How does the current system work and what are its problems  
2nd half - How does my new system work and why it is 1) feasible and 2) solves problems faced by old system  

Q4) What are the components of a specification?  
Purpose is to answer the "WHAT" of the program  
i.e. what is the program going to do, what functionalities does the program for its users? It is all rather front-end based (ie think of what the client and the potential customer of the client might use)  
In SIA, a specification for an airline ticket booking system can detail what is the booking system going to look like (user interfaces)  
In DBS, a specification for a system to view top investments could have a page detailing which category of investments to review  
In Marche, a specification for a cashier system is what are the cashier user interface, what other equipment/sensors are needed (i.e card readers)  

Q5) What is software design?  
Design can be separated into many types  
It is not to be confused with Documentation, which covers the same thing but it is less technical as it is meant for users  
Types of design include: 1) Hardware, 2) SOftware, 3) Usability, 4) Security and 5) Database design  
How do the different portions of the system depend on one another? (database)  

Q6) How to check for software design? (2017)
