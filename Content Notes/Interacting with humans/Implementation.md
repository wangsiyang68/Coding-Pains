### 3) Implementation

  1. Implementation  
  2. Maintenance  

1) What are the types of implementation?  
Think of it on a scale; on two extreme ends we have direct changeover (1 system) and parallel changeover (2 system).  
In the middle we have pilot testing (only on a limited section of the entire organization) and phased implementation (only on a limited section of the process)  

2) What are the types of maintenance?  
Preventative, Corrective, Perfective; Perfective and adaptive seem pretty similar though
