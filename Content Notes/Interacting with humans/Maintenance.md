**Name and describe  two types of maintenance. For each type, give an example for the swipe card system [6]**  

Any two of the following four will do:

1. **Perfective** Maintenance is centered on improvements for refinement and efficiency. For example, the current system requires 1 minute for the reader to process the swipe card data and open the classroom door. Refining the system can help to reduce time taken to open doors, making it more effective.
2. **Adaptive** Maintenance is the modification of algorithms or data structure of program to meet new specifications by users. For example, the system may only work at school hours. However, given that the school will start earlier and end later, the system needs to be updated to allow entry to the classrooms at earlier and later timings of the new school hours.
3. **Corrective** Maintenance is the correcting of bugs that have been found during use of program. For example, staff may need to swipe the card very slowly in order to be able to unlock the door. Better card readers can be installed instead to address this issue.
4. **Predictive** Maintenance is made in anticipation for likely future changes. For example, the school is building new blocks and the expected increase in card readers for new classrooms are likely to overwhelm the servers in the existing system. By improving the servers to handle more data efficiently, the system can now better handle an increase in card readers in the future.
