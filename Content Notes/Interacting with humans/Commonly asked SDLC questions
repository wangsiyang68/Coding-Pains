Possible SDLC question types can be split into **3** domains
    1. Analysis
    2. Development
    3. Implementation
    
First and foremost:
Understanding context
The context of the question is of a problem faced by an organization.
Such problems and organizations are easy to find, for example searching the top 10 industries and its companines in the world
Look at such organizations and think from a Administrative/Paper/HR/Logistics perspective -- What are some of the problems they can face?

In my contexts, I will make use of 3 companies from 3 different industries:

1. Singapore Airlines -- stocktaking of aircraft, airline ticket booking system, airline check-in system
2. DBS -- top investments, top people who owe bank money, accounting books, payroll system, interest payout system, atm system
3. Marche -- staff scheduling systems, peformance ranking systems, food stock-taking system, cashier system, food ordering system

1. Analysis

Feasbility study and Analysis
Specification
Design

Q1) What are 3 methods that a system analyst can use to find out more about information?
3 main ways to find out more info - 1) Interview, 2) Survey, 3) Observation
Explain characteristics of the three fact-finding types:
(expln)

Therefore, 
Interview CEO/Head of Admin/Head of HR
Give survey for many mid-level workers
Observe how work is done from the start point to the end point

Q2) What are some of the common problems?
Paper systems:
lack data integrity as same information can be stored in multiple paper systems, resulting in data redundancy which promotes data disintegrity?
lack data validation systems to prevent wrong data types from being entered
lack data verification systems (i.e. accidentally typing in wrong password, typing in amount of money owed, 
Other problems faced:
Company has scaled up, cannot deal with so much data
Improve quality/save costs by automating repetitive tasks
Tech has become old/backward/prone to failure over a long period of time
Q3) What are the components in the Report?
1st half - How does the current system work and what are its problems
2nd half - How does my new system work and why it is 1) feasible and 2) solves problems faced by old system

Q3) What are the components of a specification?
Purpose is to answer the "WHAT" of the program
i.e. what is the program going to do, what functionalities does the program for its users? It is all rather front-end based (ie think of what the client and the potential customer of the client might use)
In SIA, a specification for an airline ticket booking system can detail what is the booking system going to look like (user interfaces)
In DBS, a specification for a system to view top investments could have a page detailing which category of investments to review
In Marche, a specification for a cashier system is what are the cashier user interface, what other equipment/sensors are needed (i.e card readers)

Q4) What is software design?
Design can be separated into many types
It is not to be confused with Documentation, which covers the same thing but it is less technical as it is meant for users
Types of design include: 1) Hardware, 2) SOftware, 3) Usability, 4) Security and 5) Database design
How do the different portions of the system depend on one another? (database)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Development

Documentation
Programming
Testing

Q1) What are the components of a Documentation?
Documentations can be split into two main groups Technical/Maintenance documentation and user documentation
Its purpose is to provide client with materials to teach how to use software/system as intended
For user documentation, think of those user manuals that come in the boxes of electrical appliances:
    1. Purpose of system
    2. Min hardware and software requirements
    3. Installation procedure
    4. Detailed How tos (i.e. tutorials that show example input and its expected output
 
Q2) What are the types of programming paradigms?
Top down vs Bottom up

Q3) What are the types of testing and its pros and cons? (List in order pls!)
Black and White Box Testing
Alpha and Beta/Acceptance Testing
Unit Testing?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Implementation

Implementation
Maintenance

1) What are the types of implementation?
Think of it on a scale; on two extreme ends we have direct changeover (1 system) and parallel changeover (2 system).
In the middle we have pilot testing (only on a limited section of the entire organization) and phased implementation (only on a limited section of the process)

2) What are the types of maintenance?
Preventative, Corrective, Perfective; Perfective and adaptive seem pretty similar though
