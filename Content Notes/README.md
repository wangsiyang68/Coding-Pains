## Overview of the H2 Computing Syllabus

1. Problem Solving

- Algorithms
  - Sorting (Bubble/ Insertion/ Quick sort & comparison of efficiencies)
  - Searching (Linear/ Binary/ Hash Table Search & comparison of efficiencies)
  - Modulo (For indexing in hashtables)
  - Parsing of file (Strictly not an algorithm, but the idea is always more or less the same)
- Abstraction
  - Basic Data Types (**Str**ing/**Int**eger/**Float**/**Bool**ean)
  - Common ways to apply basic data types to store information (ASCII/ Unicode)
  - In built Data Structures (Array/ List/ Tuple/ Dictionary)
  - Self built Data Structures (Not limited to: Stack/ Queue/ Binary Tree. Implied knowledge of class properties when building data structures, such as: Encapsulation/ Inheritance/ Polymorphism)
- QC (Quality Control)
  - Error types (Syntax/ Logic/ Arithmetic/ Semantic)
  - Testing & Debugging
  - Data Validation Techniques, Data Validation and Verification
  - Good programming techniques (comments, indentation, white space and meaningful names)
  - Models to help frame thinking (Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)/ Decision Table/ Pseudocode/ Step wise Refinement/ Data Specification/Top Down Design/ Modular Design)

2. Interacting with everything but humans
