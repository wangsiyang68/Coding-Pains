## Overview of Problem Solving

1. [Abstraction](https://github.com/wangsiyang68/Coding-Pains/tree/master/Content%20Notes/Problem%20Solving/Algorithms)  
    1. [Basic Data Types (BDT)](https://github.com/wangsiyang68/Coding-Pains/tree/master/Content%20Notes/Problem%20Solving/Abstraction/Basic%20Data%20Types)
    2. [Common applications of BDT](https://github.com/wangsiyang68/Coding-Pains/tree/master/Content%20Notes/Problem%20Solving/Abstraction/Common%20applications%20of%20BDT)  
    3. [In built Data Structures](https://github.com/wangsiyang68/Coding-Pains/blob/master/Content%20Notes/Problem%20Solving/Abstraction/In%20built%20Data%20Structures/Arrays%20%26%20Lists.md)  
    4. Self built Data Structures 
2. [Algorithms](https://github.com/wangsiyang68/Coding-Pains/tree/master/Content%20Notes/Problem%20Solving/Algorithms)  
    1. [Sorting](https://github.com/wangsiyang68/Coding-Pains/tree/master/Content%20Notes/Problem%20Solving/Algorithms/Sorting)  
    2. [Searching](https://github.com/wangsiyang68/Coding-Pains/tree/master/Content%20Notes/Problem%20Solving/Algorithms/Searching)  
    3. Modulo  
    4. Parsing of files (Strictly not an algorithm, but the idea is always more or less the same)
3. [QC (Quality Control)](https://github.com/wangsiyang68/Coding-Pains/tree/master/Content%20Notes/Problem%20Solving/QC)  
    1. Error types 
    2. Testing & Debugging
    3. Data Validation and Verification
    4. Good programming techniques 
    5. Models to help frame thinking
