## Overview of Problem Solving

1. Abstraction
    1. [ ] Basic Data Types (BDT)
    2. [ ] Common applications of BDT
    3. [ ] In built Data Structures 
    4. [ ] Self built Data Structures 
2. Algorithms
    1. [ ] Sorting  
    2. [ ] Searching 
    3. [ ] Modulo  
    4. [ ] Parsing of files (Strictly not an algorithm, but the idea is always more or less the same)
3. QC (Quality Control)
    1. [ ] Error types 
    2. [ ] Testing & Debugging
    3. [ ] Data Validation and Verification
    4. [ ] Good programming techniques 
    5. [ ] Models to help frame thinking
