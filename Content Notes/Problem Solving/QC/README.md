## What makes good code, good?

Good code is one that is reliable and easily modified.  

Being reliable means that the code should be able to:  
1. Consistently show the same output for same input (Pseudocode, Decision Tables)
2. Show correct input (Test Cases, Decision Tables, Data Verification/Validation, Error Types)

Having easily modified code is important in the real world, since projects are often done with teams of people working together.
As with any good programmer, you would have tried reading other people's code, and realised how hard it is to understand a different style of writing code.  
Even if you work alone, you may be required to modify existing code 6 months later as requirements change.
If you wrote it in a haphazard way, it would almost be akin to reading someone else's code.  
Such problems can be avoided with the right thinking models, good programming habits and quality pseudocode
