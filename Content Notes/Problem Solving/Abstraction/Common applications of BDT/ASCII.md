## 1.2.1 ASCII

ASCII values are binary numbers with 7 bits. Hence, they are numbered from 0 to 128.  
Due to its short number length, ASCII values are unable to represent characters from languages other than English. However, despite its lack of usage, it is still important to roughly know ASCII since it forms the basis of the now more commonly used Unicode.
