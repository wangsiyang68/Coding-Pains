## 1.1.3 Basic Data Types: Boolean

- Assignment: ` boolean = True ` or boolean = False

  Note that any value that is not empty will give a boolean value of `True`, while any empty value will give a boolean value of `False

  - Name of Class: bool`

  | False      | True                            |
  | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
  | `bool(0)`  | `bool(2)`                       |
  | `bool("")` | `bool("coding")`                |
  | `bool([])` | `bool(["coding", "is", "fun"])` |

- Operations:

  Booleans are often used with And, Or & Not operators.

  Here are some examples:

  | And   | False   | True    |
  | ----- | ------- | ------- |
  | False | `False` | `False` |
  | True  | `False` | `True`  |

  | Or    | False   | True   |
  | ----- | ------- | ------ |
  | False | `False` | `True` |
  | True  | `True`  | `True` |

  The not operator will turn False into True, while True will turn into False.
