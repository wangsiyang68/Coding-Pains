## Introduction to In built Data Structures

An in built data structure is like a more ups way to represent information, since it allows for more ways to manipulate it.  
For example, you could now add and remove items from the string, while you would not have been able to do so with the same string, since strings are immutable.  
Dictionaries are like lists on steriods, because instead of using the numbers 0 to length of the list to represent the index, it allows you to create your own representation of the index. This is especially useful when you need to have a link between a list of two things, and neither of them are a set of continuous numbers. However, do note that they can get difficult to manipulate. One example of this is that using the .keys() function will result in an output of type 'dict_keys', which is immutable.  
Honestly I'm not sure why people still use tuples, since I see it as just lists but immutable. Anybody able to enlighten me on this?
