# Sorting is what?

**Three main types of sort algorithms :**

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Quick Sort
4. Merge Sort (Cool but not tested)

**Characteristics of each sort and how do they compare with each other?**

1. Best/Worst/Average Case

2. Paradigm (Divide and Conquer/Recursive/Iterative)

3. Comparison v Non Comparison Strategies

4. Stability of algorithm

   A stable algorithm is said to preserve the initial order of elements with the same key

**How can I test my knowledge of Sorting? (Credit: VisuAlgo)**

Sorting as a tool is useful in the following problems:

1. Searching for a specific value **v** in array **A**,
2. Finding the min/max or the k-th smallest/largest value in (static) array **A**,
3. Testing for uniqueness and deleting duplicates in array **A**,
4. Counting how many time a specific value **v** appear in array **A**,
5. Set intersection/union between array **A** and another sorted array **B**,
6. Finding a target pair **x** ∈ **A** and **y** ∈ **A** such that **x+y** equals to a target **z**, etc. (what does this mean??)

**What are some other ways I can modify my sort?**

Different Items

1. Sort a list of numbers (basic)
2. Sort a list of strings with varying lengths
3. Sort a list of lists based on the inner list's second item

Different Data Structures

1. Sort a linked list
2. Sort a dictionary
